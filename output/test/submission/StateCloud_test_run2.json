It’s humiliating. We’ll do it. We’ll start again. We’ll grow\nOne of my concerns is this demoralisation question\nIn this debate it seems to me, and actually the way Mr Cameron posed it, was you got a choice of being mollycoddled at home by your mum and dad, or you demand that you’re sustained by the State.\nDon’t you think that we need to encourage young people to see a third way, an alternative to that?\"",
