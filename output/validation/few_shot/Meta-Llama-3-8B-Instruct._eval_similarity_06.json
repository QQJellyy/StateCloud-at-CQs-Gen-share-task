The author argues that if passengers must pay a fee to change their own reservations, the airline should also be required to compensate passengers when they change the flight schedule. However, the question suggests that the airline's lack of compensation may indicate that they are not truly inconvenienced by the changes, but rather are simply exercising their own flexibility at the expense of the passenger's planning and convenience.

It also opens up opportunities for Clinton to discuss potential limitations or biases in her approach, and potentially reveal underlying assumptions or values that inform her policy priorities."
